    question: 'How many projects can I build with Devias Kit PRO?',
    answer:
      "LexPal offers a free version accessible to all users. Additionally, we provide a premium subscription option, offering enhanced content and learning opportunities for those seeking deeper engagement.",

  {
    question: 'Why not go with any tandem partner?',
    answer:
      "While tandem partners are valuable, not everyone is an ideal match. Many conversation exchange apps result in unproductive experiences due to mismatched expectations. Some learners pursue language acquisition as a hobby, while others aim to navigate various life transitions or excel in academic pursuits. LexPal emphasizes quality over quantity, prioritizing optimal matches based on your learning goals, saving you time and enabling focused learning experiences.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Why not talk to AI?',
    answer:
      'While AI offers valuable support, human interaction remains essential for mastering regional dialects, informal phrases, humor, and slangâ€”the nuances of native fluency. LexPal emphasizes human-to-human practice, mirroring real-life language scenarios. Our AI complements this approach, enriching the learning journey.',
